Messing around with the fitness-fatigue model in R.

Note that I'm pretty much new to R, so don't expect anything exemplary :P

Anyway, the fitness fatigue model is a pretty cool model for predicting the effects of training on performance. I'm gonna be using it pretty much the way it is formulated in:

Mark Pfeiffer, Modeling the Relationship between Training and Perfomance - A Comparison of Two Antagonistic Concepts

supersimple.R
simple calculation and plotting of performance function using preset workload and arbitrary units

...Add some descriptions of scripts when they are done :P
for now, just run stuff with Rscript or something and see for yourself
